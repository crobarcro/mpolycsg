Matlab/Octave m-code interface to computational solid geometry libraries based on pyPolyCSG

A C++ wrapper for the Carve Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) library, and more experimentally, the CGAL library, intended to simplify performing CSG operations on meshes. The wrapper depends on the pyPolyCSG project by James Gregson. Currently a forked version of the pyPolyCSG project is required (available: https://github.com/crobarcro/pyPolyCSG), but it is likely the changes in the forked version of the project will be merged back into the main project in the future.
